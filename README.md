# Financial Market Prediction with LSTM

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for **predicting financial market trends** using raw historical price data. The project is written in Python and aims to be **expandable**, **scalable**, and ready for **future trading automation**.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Trains on raw OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) price data  
- ✅ Uses LSTM to learn temporal price patterns  
- ✅ Modular structure for easy expansion  
- ✅ Designed for integration into automated trading systems  
- 🔄 *In progress*: Enhancing prediction logic using advanced **technical analysis**, including RTM, ICT and Smart Money concepts

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib
