# Financial Market Prediction with LSTM

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for **predicting financial market trends** using raw historical price data. It is written in Python and designed to be **expandable**, **scalable**, and suitable for **future trading automation**.

Note: While financial markets are far too complex to rely on a single predictive tool for consistent trading success, projects like this can offer **helpful insights** and act as a **confirmation layer** when combined with proper technical analysis and market understanding.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Trains on raw OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) price data  
- ✅ Uses LSTM to learn temporal price patterns  
- ✅ Modular structure for easy expansion  
- ✅ Designed for integration into automated trading systems  
- 🔄 *In progress*: Enhancing prediction logic using advanced **technical analysis**, including RTM, ICT, and Smart Money concepts

## 📈 Project Status

- **Started:** February 2023  
- **Current Phase:** Ongoing development and experimentation  

### 🎯 Long-Term Goal
To build a practical tool that can be used for **trend confirmation** or **trade prediction**, especially when combined with **technical analysis methods** such as RTM and ICT Smart Money.

### 🔄 Current Focus
Still in development

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib
